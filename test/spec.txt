1)  A process is a sequence of steps an actor or actors take to achieve a business goal.

2)  A process must be uniquely identifiable system wide. ............passing

3)  There can be several steps in a process but there must be atleast one step. ...........passing

4)  Steps can either involve collecting input from a user or from another system generated event.

5)  A step must be uniquely identifiable within a process. .................passing

6)  Steps can have a chain of processors but the chain must have atleast one. .................passing

7)  Steps can have a chain of post processors but no minimum is required. .....................passing

8)  Steps requiring user input must contain a form. .............................passing

9)  A process can describe its required steps. .................................passing

9)  A step can describe its form and processors. ...............................passing

9)  A form can describe its elements properties and validators. .......................passing

10) Processess are created with a unique id,title,description and steps. ......................passing

11) Steps are created with id ,type and processors. .............................................passing

12) Client Steps require a form. ............................................passing

12) Processors can modify the regular flow of steps. ........................ passing

13) Processors are uniquely identifiable system wide. 

14) Processors can create entities................................passing

15) Processors can edit entities. ..............................passing

16) Processors can delete entities. ............................. pending

17) A process can be returned to when not completed.

18) A form must contain atleast one element. ........................................passing.

19) An element can contain any number of validators. ................................passing.

20) Validators can either run on the clients machine or externally.



Secure Sandbox Idea.
- Create a sandbox child process.
- Send Description of context to child process.
a) Create method hooks for context object in parent.
b) Create equivalent methods in context object in sandbox child process.
c) Shutdown sandbox when all processors have finished executing.
